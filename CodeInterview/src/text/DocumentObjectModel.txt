The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for 
representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents.
Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects.

Web browsers usually use an internal model similar to the DOM in order to render a document (such as an HTML page). 
The DOM APIs are also used to inspect or modify a Web page from JavaScript code. In other words, the Document Object Model is the way JavaScript sees the browser state and the HTML page it contains.
When an HTML page is rendered in a browser, the browser parses the markup (e.g. HTML), downloaded from the web-server into an in-memory DOM. The DOM is used to construct additional internal structures used to display the page in the browser window.
The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree. The topmost node in the DOM tree is the Document object. Each node has zero or more children.

An example of a DOM tree is shown below:

 |-> Document
   |-> Element (<html>)
     |-> Element (<body>)
       |-> Element (<div>)
         |-> text node
         |-> Anchor
           |-> text node
       |-> Form
            |-> Text-box
            |-> Text Area
            |-> Radio Button
            |-> Check Box
            |-> Select
            |-> Button
